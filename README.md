# ani-list
a CLI tool to help you find anime to watch, intended for use with one of the many anime cli watching programs.
Since my thing is basically just 2 python files you can download [api.py](https://github.com/rami-droid/ani-list/blob/main/api.py) if you wanna use my jinkan api implementation. Only requirement is the requests python package.

## TODO
  - add more api stuff
  - making it look nice
  - persistence features

## stuff I used 
  - jinkan api
  - rich, and Typer
