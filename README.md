# ani-list

a CLI tool to help you find anime to watch, intended for use with one of the many
anime cli watching programs.
Since my thing is basically just 2 python files you can download [api.py](https://github.com/rami-droid/ani-list/blob/main/api.py)
if you wanna use my jinkan api
implementation. Only requirement is the requests python package.

## Commands

- `search`
- `details`
- `top-airing`

## TODO

- add more api stuff
- making it look nice
- persistence features

## stuff I used

- jinkan api
- rich, and Typer
